## Decisions

I've chosen to use the create-react-app in order to get the project configured and ready to be developed. 

Another decision that I've taken, as the short time, not to focus in a beutiful layout. I tried to do as much features as possible. Then I created a list of tasks to be done by priority order and I did this list:
- List of chats component
- Message component
- Chat component
- Split the messages by their date
- Open a specific chat by click on the chat list
- Search chats by the requester
- Search chats by the initial message

Then I created the repository and I did my first commit after the create-react-app finish the setup of my project. This way you can see the time of my first commit and the time of my last commit and be sure about my time spent during the assessment.

I finished all the tasks that I had planned with three and half hours after started, so I decided to do one more task with the rest of my time: group messages sent by the same person at the same time (hour and minutes equal). However, my time finished and I hadn't finished this task yet because I had found an issue. Then I decided to leave the master branch with the previous code without this last feature, and I created another branch [grouping-messages](https://github.com/andersonbispo/se-chat/tree/grouping-messages) and a [pull request](https://github.com/andersonbispo/se-chat/pull/1) for it.

Another decision was do not write tests. I had avaliate all the features I had to do and I thoughtI wouldn't have time to write tests and finish all the features I had planned in four hours.

Finally, I decided after my time is over, to put the app on Firebase in order to let you test the application with no needing to install it in a machine. You can access [here](https://se-chat-6c94b.firebaseapp.com/).
